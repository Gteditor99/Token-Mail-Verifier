# Discord Token Mail Verifier
This tool is used to verify email of any discord token. It can claim a tokens as well.


## How To Run?
> 1) Clone / download this repository
> 2) Open the folder in command prompt or terminal
> 3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
> 4) Run `python main.py`


## Planned
> + 60 stars: Make it resend the mail if kopeechka has not received an email from discord.
> + 100 stars: Improved headers, which means it gets patched slower, would work better and provide higher quality tokens.
